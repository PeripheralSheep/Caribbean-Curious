Showcases the work done for the Caribbean Science Foundation Web-Development Coding Workshop done in 2021. It was a group project that utilized HTML, CSS, JavaScript and leaflet.js to create an interactive map system to learn things about the different Caribbean countries. Only information for Barbados was placed.
